# Nefeli: Accessible Cryptocurrency for Human beens

Nefeli is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency designed to empower individuals by ensuring mining remains accessible to everyone, not dominated by large mining farms. Forked from Wownero, Nefeli inherits its commitment to decentralization and inclusivity but focuse on a scope to make Cryptocurrency mining available for all humans

# Nefeli Tokenomics

Nefeli is designed to offer fast transactions, predictable emissions, and a secure blockchain. This document outlines the tokenomics for Nefeli with a block time of **1 minute** and a steady block reward.

## Tokenomics Table

| **Parameter**         | **Value**                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Block Reward**       | 1 Nefeli                        |
| **Block Time**         | 60 seconds (1 minute)           |
| **Blocks per Day**     | `24 * 60 = 1440`                |
| **Daily Emission**     | `1440 × 1 = 1440 Nefeli`        |
| **Annual Emission**    | `1440 × 365 = 525,600 Nefeli`   |
| **Total Supply**       | Unlimited (optional cap later)  |

## Tokenomics Summary

### **Steady Emission**
- Each block produces a fixed reward of **1 Nefeli**.
- This ensures predictable annual emissions of **525,600 Nefeli**.

### **Fast Transactions**
- A **1-minute block time** ensures that transactions are confirmed quickly.
- Typical transaction finality occurs within **2–4 blocks** (2–4 minutes).

### **Supply Considerations**
- **Uncapped Supply:** Emissions continue indefinitely, maintaining a steady inflation rate.
- **Capped Supply (Optional):** If capped at **21 million Nefeli**, the cap would be reached in approximately **40 years**.

## Benefits of Nefeli's Tokenomics

1. **Predictability**:
   - Steady block rewards make the supply easy to understand and calculate.

2. **Fast Confirmations**:
   - Transactions are confirmed in under 5 minutes.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Short block times support high transaction throughput.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Optional mechanisms like fee burning or supply caps can be added later.

## Additional Features

### Inflation Mitigation
- Implement a **burn mechanism** for transaction fees to offset inflation.
- Introduce **gradual reward reductions** after specific milestones.

### Security
- Adjust difficulty dynamically to handle faster block times and maintain network stability.
