# Nefeli: Accessible Cryptocurrency for Human beens

Nefeli is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency designed to empower individuals by ensuring mining remains accessible to everyone, not dominated by large mining farms. Forked from Wownero, Nefeli inherits its commitment to decentralization and inclusivity but focuse on a scope to make Cryptocurrency mining available for all humans

# Nefeli Tokenomics

Nefeli is designed to offer fast transactions, predictable emissions, and a secure blockchain. This document outlines the tokenomics for Nefeli with a block time of **1 minute** and a steady block reward.

## Tokenomics Table

| **Parameter**         | **Value**                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Block Reward**       | 1 Nefeli                        |
| **Block Time**         | 60 seconds (1 minute)           |
| **Blocks per Day**     | `24 * 60 = 1440`                |
| **Daily Emission**     | `1440 × 1 = 1440 Nefeli`        |
| **Annual Emission**    | `1440 × 365 = 525,600 Nefeli`   |
| **Total Supply**       | predictable supply. 40 years for 21 million.|

# Tokenomics: No Max Supply with Steady Emission

Nefeli uses a **steady block reward** system with no maximum supply. This tokenomic model offers distinct advantages for long-term sustainability and miner incentives. Below are the key benefits of this approach:

---

## Pros of No Max Supply with Steady Emission

### **1. Incentivizes Miners Indefinitely**
- Mining remains attractive in the long term because block rewards never drop to zero.
- A steady reward ensures miners have consistent incentives, which helps maintain network security.

### **2. Predictable Inflation**
The inflation rate decreases over time as the circulating supply grows, even with a fixed reward. This is because:
\[
\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{Block Reward} \times \text{Blocks per Year}}{\text{Total Circulating Supply}}
\]

**Example Calculations**:
- **Year 1**: 
  - 525,600 Nefeli emitted (1 Nefeli/block × 525,600 blocks/year)
  - Total supply = 525,600
  - Inflation = 100%
- **Year 10**:
  - 525,600 Nefeli emitted
  - Total supply ≈ 5,256,000
  - Inflation ≈ 10%
- **Year 50**:
  - Inflation approaches ~1% as the supply grows larger.

### **3. Long-Term Ecosystem Stability**
- Coins continue entering the market, supporting liquidity and activity.
- Ensures future generations can still mine or earn Nefeli.

### **4. Simplicity**
- Easy for users and investors to understand.
- “1 Nefeli per block, forever” is straightforward and predictable.

This model ensures the Nefeli network remains secure, liquid, and accessible while maintaining long-term sustainability. Let us know if you'd like to learn more or contribute to the Nefeli ecosystem!

## Tokenomics Summary

### **Steady Emission**
- Each block produces a fixed reward of **1 Nefeli**.
- This ensures predictable annual emissions of **525,600 Nefeli**.

### **Fast Transactions**
- A **1-minute block time** ensures that transactions are confirmed quickly.
- Typical transaction finality occurs within **2–4 blocks** (2–4 minutes).

### **Supply Considerations**
- **Uncapped Supply:** Emissions continue indefinitely, maintaining a steady inflation rate.
- **Capped Supply (Optional):** If capped at **21 million Nefeli**, the cap would be reached in approximately **40 years**.

---

## Benefits of Nefeli's Tokenomics

1. **Predictability**:
   - Steady block rewards make the supply easy to understand and calculate.

2. **Fast Confirmations**:
   - Transactions are confirmed in under 5 minutes.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Short block times support high transaction throughput.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Optional mechanisms like fee burning or supply caps can be added later.

---

## Additional Features

### Inflation Mitigation
- Implement a **burn mechanism** for transaction fees to offset inflation.
- Introduce **gradual reward reductions** after specific milestones.

### Security
- Adjust difficulty dynamically to handle faster block times and maintain network stability.
